  <h1 style="color: white">Various - Kontrol Energy Corp.</h1>
  <h4 style="color: white">
    As a Full-Stack Developer at Kontrol Energy, I was involved in numerous
    projects that will have positive impacts on Kontrol, their clients, and
    even the general public. I am not at liberty to say what these projects
    were, however, I will say that I am proud to have been a contributing
    member to the development team at Kontrol Energy. Additionally, I
    gained valuable experience in agile development and skills in technologies
    such as React, Java, and GraphQL. Take a look at Kontrol's website to
    learn more about some of their projects and products.

<div class="projects-content projects-this-website">
  <h1 style="color: white">This Website</h1>
  <h4 style="color: white">
    This website is one of the first projects I worked on. I created it to
    showcase my programming skills to prospective employers. Over three years,
    it has undergone a number of changes. You can take a look at the source
    code by visiting the github link at the bottom of this section.

    <br><br>

    I began the process of building a website in my first-year of university.
    At the time, I had no experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or UI/UX. I
    started from scratch and learned through online tutorials and plenty of
    trial and error. Over time I have gained skills in each of these concepts.
    I would say that my foremost interest is web development and UI/UX, and
    that probably has something to do with my experience building this site.

    <br><br>

    Although this site did not help me achieve my first internship at Ontario
    Shores, it did help me to secure my second internship at Kontrol Energy.
    As a Full-Stack Developer I spend a significant amount of time on both
    design and front-end implementation.

  <h1 style="color: white">Various - Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences</h1>
  <h4 style="color: white">
    As a Business Analyst and Developer at Ontario Shores, I wore many hats
    and contributed to many different projects. My main role was to build a
    system of scripts to automate staffing processes using PowerShell and
    Summit Scripting Toolkit. By implementing this system, I saved the IT
    department multiple hours daily and freed up another analyst to take care
    of other critical staffing tasks.

    <br><br>

    Additionally, I contributed to ontarioshores.ca by enhancing useability
    and cleaning up the codebase. I was also a valuable member of the IT
    service team and developed crucial customer service skills and learned
    to troubleshoot hardware and software problems with ease.

    <h4 style="color: white">
      In my third year at university, I was introduced to software development
      while building a mobile app called "Planit". This app was built using
      React Native and Java. The development team consisted of 7 students,
      including myself. We followed agile best-practices and
      presented our product to the client at the end of the semester.

      <br><br>

      This experience highlighted the challenges of agile development and
      helped prepare me for my Co-op experience as a Full-Stack Developer at
      Kontrol Energy. As the scrum master for this particular project, I was
      responsible for maintaining order within our development team and
      ensuring that best practices were followed, while learning React Native
      on the fly. I believe that this was a valuable experience in my journey
      towards a career in software development.

<div class="projects-content projects-angular">
  <h1 style="color: white">Angular Order Form</h1>
  <h4 style="color: white">
    I developed a simple online order form while learning to develop with
    Angular. This project demonstrates my eagerness to learn, focus on
    useability, and keen development abilities. I made the decision to learn
    Angular this past summer while taking 8 courses at two different
    universities. I believe that this shows my exemplary work ethic and
    programming skills. Take a look at the project in the github repo
    linked below.
