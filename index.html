        <h2>Software Development</h2>
        <div>
          I am currently working as a programmer at Ontario Shores Center for
          Mental Health Sciences. I have used PowerShell and Summit Scripting
          Toolkit to automate staffing processes while also contributing to
          some website design projects using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
          <br><br>
          In the past I have used Python and Java to complete school and
          personal projects. I am in the process of designing a dating app with
          a friend that requires the use of both Java and React.

        <h2>Management</h2>
        <div>
          My first job came in grade 10 at a Victoria McDonald's. By the time I
          was in grade 12 I was one of the key managers for my branch, handling
          multiple programs and closing the restaurant nightly. Before leaving
          the job to travel for a year, I was offered the position of head manager.
          <br> <br>
          In the eight months preceding university I worked two jobs simultaneously.
          One job involved marketing for a start-up house maintenance business.
          Within a month of being hired to as a marketer for this company I was
          asked to manage the marketing team.

      <div class="expPara">
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <div>
          Throughout my time in high school I was involved in the Victoria music
          scene. I was a member of the Vic High R & B band for five years as the lead guitarist.
          During my time in the band, we travelled to Ontario, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi
          to record and perform.
          <br><br>
          I was also the performing bass player and studio guitar player for Close the Bombay Doors,
          a band composed of young musicians from Victoria, BC. We released an EP in 2016
          and performed across Vancouver Island and in Seattle, Washington.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="expPara">
        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <div>
          Between high school and university I took a year off to work and travel.
          Over the course of 6 months abroad, I visited 22 countries and made some
          incredible memories while visiting places like Venice, Chernobyl, Yangshuo,
          and Pyongyang. With each new adventure my friends and I liked to strive
          out of our comfort zones a little bit more and explore the unknown.
          I developed an interest in the applications of communism and can say I have been to 
          Vietnam, China, North Korea, and Cuba which are all either former or
          current communist states.

      <div class="edPara">
        <h2>High School</h2>
        <div>
          I attended Reynolds Secondary School in my hometown of Victoria, BC
          from September 2012 until June of 2016. I graduated with a 96%
          average and excelled in Physics, Calculus, History, and English.
          I was awarded an entrance scholarship to UTSC based on my outstanding
          grades in addition to multiple provincial Dogwood scholarships (BC).
          <br> <br>
          Throughout high school, I took a keen interest in music and I was
          always involved in multiple musical endevors. I was a part of the
          Victoria High School Rhythm and Blues Band, a audition and performance
          based group that travelled across North America for shows and record
          sessions. I was also a member of Close the Bombay Doors, a indie rock
          band that released an EP on Apple Music and Spotify.
        </div>

      <div class="edPara">
        <h2>University</h2>
        <div>
          After taking a year off to work and travel, I moved to Toronto to
          attend the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) for a computer science
          undergraduate degree. I was accepted into the program after achieving
          excellent grades in 6 core first-year courses ranging from calculus
          to linear algebra. I also excelled in my breadth courses, including
          African studies (for which I received an
          emerging scholars award) and political science.
          <br> <br>
          I began my second year immediately following the first with four core
          courses in the summer semester. I continued to maintain an exemplary
          GPA and made the Dean's list. I also secured an eight month co-op job
          at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health
          Sciences. After my work term concludes, I plan to return to UTSC to
          continue in computer science.
